Heat Island Mapping

This Capstone Project consisted of creating a device capable of recording temperature, humidity, longitude, latitude and storing it onboard and offboard storage solutions. Initially my team planned to use AWS but the code required was too massive for my team to utilize without making the board (Arduino MKR 1010) unstable and crashing. We swapped to using Google Spreadsheets as our cloud solution. We connected a display to the board so that the user can see the readings as they are taken.
